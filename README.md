# Lab 2:  More HTML 5 and CSS, Introducing JavaScript
 
In this lab we will continue to develop our mobile web app. You will learn to:
 
- Add a separate CSS for landscape orientation
- Use HTML 5 <video> and <audio> tags
- Add a back button to the header
- Add interactive behavior with JavaScript
- Implement in-app links
 
## Your Task
Build an interactive Bike WPI web app similar to this one: http://users.wpi.edu/~esolovey/cs3041/lab2/
(open with your mobile device or simulator)
 
## Step-by-Step Tutorial
 
**Step 0:** Fork this repository ([Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)) so that you have a copy of if in your Github account. 

**Step 0a:** Clone your *lab2* repository so that you have a local copy on your computer ([Help](https://github.com/cs3041-c24/lab0/blob/main/README.md#3-clone-and-edit-your-project))

**Step 0b:** Copy all files from your Lab 1 into the new Lab 2 directory.  

**Need help of Github Command:** ([See page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html))

**Step 1:** In the previous lab we created a website styled for mobile, then we customized it to behave like a native app. Now, we will add a separate CSS file for landscape orientation.
 
Create a new CSS file named *landscape.css* and save it in your project directory. Copy its content from *style.css* and then make style changes (e.g. change the background color of the `<header>` or `<body>`).
In addition, let's change the style of the `<nav>` tag. We will aim for an iOS menu style. 
Remove all the `#main_nav` styles in *landscape.css*. Replace the definitions of #main_nav as following:
```css
#main_nav ul {
	list-style: none;
	padding: 0;
	margin: 10px;
	font-weight: bold;
}
 
#main_nav ul li {
	background-color: #fff;
	border: 1px solid #999;
	color: #222;
	display: block;
	margin-bottom: -1px;
	padding: 12px 10px;
}
 
#main_nav ul li a{
	text-decoration: none;
  }
  
/* add traditional rounded corners to the navigation menu*/

#main_nav li:first-child{
    -webkit-border-top-left-radius: 8px;
    -webkit-border-top-right-radius: 8px;
}
 
#main_nav li:last-child{
    -webkit-border-bottom-left-radius: 8px;
    -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius: 8px;
}
``` 
**Step 2:** Now, we need to go back to index.html and add separate links to portrait and to landscape orientations. Replace the current link to a stylesheet link with the following lines:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" media="screen and (orientation:portrait)"/>
 
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="landscape.css" media="screen and (orientation:landscape)"/>
```
✔️ Checkpoint: 
[Test the application](https://github.com/cs3041-c24/lab0#5-access-your-web-page) on a device, when you rotate the device (or simulator) your page should look something like this:

![](https://github.com/cs3041-c24/lab2/blob/main/media/image2.png)
  
Ok. Now, that we have a webapp that responds to device orientation. We can move on and add additional pages to our app.
 
## Working with video and audio
 
**Step 3:** Create a new HTML 5 file ride.html (if you don’t already have one). Working in ride.html, add a `<header>` to the file and make its style consistent with the style we defined for index.html. The text in the header should be “Sights and Sounds”.
 
**Step 4:** Working in *ride.html* add the following lines inside the `<body>`:
 
HTML5 defines a new element, which specifies a standard way to embed a video/movie on a web page: the `<video>` element.
```html
<p> Playing around: </p>
<video width="300" height="220" controls>
	<source src="Bear_movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	<source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume. It is also a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are set, the space required for the video is reserved when the page is loaded.
You should also insert text content between the `<video>` and `</video>` tags for browsers that do not support the `<video>` element.

The `<video>` element allows multiple `<source>` elements. `<source>` elements can link to different video files. The browser will use the first recognized format.
HTML5 also defines a new element, which specifies a standard way to embed an audio file on a web page: the `<audio>` element.
```html
<p> Horsing around: </p>
<audio width=300 controls>
  	<source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  	<source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    	Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```
The controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.
You should also insert text content between the `<audio>` and `</audio>` tags for browsers that do not support the `<audio>` element.

The `<audio>` element allows multiple `<source>` elements. `<source>` elements can link to different audio files. The browser will use the first recognized format.
  
**Step 5:** Style your page, working within style.css.
First, add style for your `<video>` tag by setting its border, padding, margin-top, margin-bottom, and border-radius.
 
Also use the following example to define the video transitions style.
```css
video {
 	/* add your style definitions here */
 
 	/* transitions applied to the video element */
 	-moz-transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
 	-webkit-transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
 	-o-transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
 	-ms-transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
 	transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
}
```
Now, write your code to style your `<audio>` tag. No need to define transitions for your `<audio>` tag.
 
When you’re done, things should look something like this:
![](https://github.com/cs3041-c24/lab2/blob/main/media/image4.png)
 
Adding a button to the `<header>`
 
**Step 6:** Next, let’s add a back button. Working in ride.html add the following line to the `<body>`:  	
```html
<button class="back">Back</button>
```
 
We will use CSS to position this button in the header.
 
Working in *style.css*, add the following lines:
```css
button.back {
/*These lines override the previous styling of buttons*/
-webkit-border-image: url("greyButton.png") 0 14 0 14 stretch;
width:60px;
height: 30px;
 
/*These lines position the back button inside the header*/
position:absolute;
left:16px;
top:8px;
}
```
 
Note that this style only applies to buttons with the class property sets to back.
We override the style definitions of general buttons, then we use absolute positioning to place the back button inside the header.
 
⚙️ Test your code.
 
It appears that you should shift the text in the `<header>` to the right. Note that we only want to shift the `<header>` text in pages that include a back button (i.e. all the secondary pages). Thus, we will set the class property in the `<header>` of those pages to “secondary”. Working in *ride.html*, add a class property to the `<header>`:
```html
<header class="secondary">Sights and sounds</header>
```
Now, to shift the text in the `<header>` to the right, we will go back to *style.css* and add the following lines:
```css
header.secondary{   
padding-left: 75px;
}
``` 
Note that we do not override the previous style definitions of  header, we just add a definition for *header.secondary*
 
⚙️ Now test your page. Things should look something like this:

![](https://github.com/cs3041-c24/lab2/blob/main/media/image3.png)
 
Note that your new back button is not functional yet. We need to use JavaScript to add interactive behavior.
 
## Introducing JavaScript
 
JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language. A scripting language is a lightweight programming language. With JavaScript code can be inserted into HTML pages. Most modern HTML pages are using JavaScript.

The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as in these languages (or nearly so.) JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language.

JavaScript is easy to learn and there are many tutorials available online (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp). In our labs we will cover some basic and important JavaScript examples but you are encouraged to explore JavaScript beyond what covered in class.

### Handling Events

Many things could happen while your web app is being displayed – buttons are being clicked, a user changes the content of an input field, your page will be done loading. All these things cause events to happen: an `onclick` event, an `onchange` event, an `onload` event.

Whenever an event occurs there is an opportunity for JavaScript code to handle it. Our job is to supply code that will be invoked when an event occurs. We do not have to handle all events but handling events is our mechanism for adding interactive behavior to an otherwise static webpage.

**Step 7:**  To make our back button interactive we need to handle its onclick event. In ride.html change the definition of the back button with the following line:
```html
<button class="back" onclick="location.href='index.html';">Back</button>
```
Now, when the user clicks the back button, the current page displayed will change to the page in the specified url.  The Location object provided by JavaScript and contains information about the current URL. We can access and change its properties as needed. To learn more about the Location object click [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_location.asp).

**Note** that we inserted JavaScript code inside the HTML5 tag within the onclick attribute (wrapped in quotation marks). Normally the HTML event attributes are used to call functions specified elsewhere inside <script> tags. In rare cases, typically when our code is very short, we will add the JavaScript code directly to event attributes.

**Step 8:** Create a new HTML 5 file Buttons.html. Working in Buttons.html, make its style consistent with the style we defined for *index.html*
 
Add the following `<body>` to your file:
```html
<body>   
<header class="secondary"> Reserve your bike</header>
<button class="back" onclick="location.href='index.html';">Back</button>
<div id="buttons">
	<button id="alertButton">Alert</button>
	<button id="promptButton">Prompt</button>
	<button id="confirmationButton">Confirm</button>
	<button id="changeButton">Change bike</button> 	
</div> 	
<div id="content"> 	  
	<img id="bikeImg" src="">
	<p id="choicelist">   	
	<ul id="orderedBike"> </ul>    
</div>
</body>
```
To style our page so that the buttons appear in the center add and complete the following code to your style.css:
```css
button {
 /*center the button*/
display: block;
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
 
/* add your code to set top and bottom margins */
 
/*add an image to your button*/
-webkit-border-image: url("orangeButton.png") 14 14 14 14 stretch;
background-size: cover;

/*set width and height for the button*/
}
 ```
Your page should look something like this:
 
![](https://github.com/cs3041-c24/lab2/blob/main/media/image6.png)

To **make this page interactive** we will **add JavaScript** code.

**Step 9:** Working in Buttons.html, add the following JavaScript code to the onclick event of `alertButton`:
```js
alert('welcome!');
```
[please note: you may need to type in the quotation marks yourself as the copy and paste sometimes results in the wrong character being used]
 
⚙️ [Test your page.](https://github.com/cs3041-c24/lab0#set-up-testing-environment)
 
What does the alert function (which is provided by JavaScript) do?

### Defining Functions, DOM Manipulation
 
**Step 10:** add the following JavaScript code to the onclick event of `promptButton`:
```js
promptButtonClicked();
```

When the user clicks the Prompt button the `promptButtonClicked` function will be invoked. **We need to write the JavaScript code for this function.**

Here is what the `promptButtonClicked` function does:

You might have noticed that we put an empty list in the HTML markup (an empty `<ul>` element to be exact with id=”orderedBike”). Every time a user enters input through a prompt message box will appear, we will capture the user input and add it to this list.

To do that we’ll create a new `<li>` element that will hold the string entered by the user. Then we will take the new `<li>` element and add it to `<ul>` element in the DOM. Once we do that, the browser will update the page.

We will add the implementation of `promptButtonClicked` within `<script>` tags at the end (but within) the `<body>` section. 

Study the following code, and then add it to the `<body>` section:
```html
<script>
function promptButtonClicked() {     	
	/*Prompt displays a message and returns a string depending on what the user has entered. It can be used for simple input. We stored the returned string in a variable.*/  
	var destination=prompt("Where would you like to ride?");
	//if the user entered a non-empty string executes the following
	if(destination !== ""){
		/*retrieve the element named choicelist from the DOM*/  
		var p=document.getElementById("choicelist");
		/*set its innerHTML attribute*/ 	
		p.innerHTML="Here is a summary of your choices";  
		/*create a brand new element and sets its innerHTML value. Note that it is not yet inserted in the DOM.*/
		 var li=document.createElement("li"); 	
		li.innerHTML=destination;
		/*Retrieve an element from the DOM. We then add our new element as a child to this element.*/
			var ul=document.getElementById("orderedBike");
		ul.appendChild(li); } 	
	}     
</script>
```

⚙️ Test your code. 
After clicking on the Prompt button and entering a string, your page should look something like that:
![](https://github.com/cs3041-c24/lab2/blob/main/media/image5.png)

**Optional step:** style your `<ul>` and `<li>` elements by adding corresponding [CSS definitions](https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_list.asp) in the style.css

**Step 11:** add the following JavaScript code to the onclick event of confirmButton:   `confirmButtonClicked();`
 
Next we will write the JavaScript code for confirmButtonClicked.

This function will ask the user to confirm. If the user clicks OK a new image of bicycle will be added to the code with accompanying confirmation text.
To do so the function will:
- set the src attribute of our currently empty `<img>` element
- create a new `<p>` element, set its innerHTML attribute, and add it to the DOM inside the relevant `<div>` element.
- add the implementation of `confirmButtonClicked` within the same `<script>` tags of `promptButtonClicked`. 

Study the following code, and then add it.
**Note** that the last two lines of codes are missing; add them to your code based on the previous example
```js
function confirmButtonClicked() {  
	/*Confirm displays a message and returns true if OK is clicked and a false if Cancel is clicked. 	You might use this for simple input */  
	var bool=confirm("Are you sure?");

	/*if the user clicked ok execute the following*/
	if(bool==true){

		//retrieve the <img> object from the DOM and set its src attribute
		var img=document.getElementById("bikeImg");
		img.src="bike1.jpg";

		//create a new <p> element and set its content
		var p=document.createElement("p");   	
		p.innerHTML="You are bike ready!";
	}
}    	                    	        	
```
⚙️ Test your code. 
After clicking on the Confirm button, your page should look something like that:
![](https://github.com/cs3041-c24/lab2/blob/main/media/image1.png)
 
**Note** that in the previous screen captures the button *Change bike* was shown. Next we will add JavaScript code that hides this button when the page is done loading. When the user clicks *Confirm* the *Change* bike button will become visible again. 

To do so we will need to first write code that handles the onload event generated when the `<body>` is done loading. Then we will add a line of code to the confirmButtonClicked function that makes the button visible.
 
### Handling onload events and changing style using JavaScript
 
**Step 12:** add the following JavaScript code to the onload event of the `<body>` element: `initBody();`. (It should look like this: `<body onLoad="initBody();">`)
 
Next we need to implement this function. Study the function and then add the following code within the same `<script>` tags of `promptButtonClicked`.
```js
function initBody() {
	// retrieve the changeButton element from the DOM and hide it
	document.getElementById("changeButton").style.visibility="hidden";  	 
}
``` 
Now **add a line of code** to the function `confirmButtonClicked` that makes the Change bike button visible.
 
⚙️ Test your code. Your Change bike button should appear when the user confirms but it is not yet functional.
 
### Local and Global variables
 
You already know that you can declare a variable by using the `var` keyword and a name. So far we only declared variables within functions, but you can declare variables anywhere in your page within `<script>` elements.  Where you declare your variables determines how visible they are to other parts of your code.
 
If a variable is declared outside a function it’s **Global**. If it is declared inside a function, it is **Local**.
 
Global variables live as long as the page. Local variables are created when your function is first called and live until the function returns.
 
Next, we will write JavaScript code for the *Change bike* button. This code will make use of both local and global variables.
 
When the *Change bike* button is clicked the image of the bicycle on the page will change. To do so we will maintain a global variable, an array of strings. Each string will be a name of an image file. When the button is clicked the invoked function will generate a random number within the range of possible array indices and display the corresponding image.
 
**Step 13:** add JavaScript code that invokes the function `changeButtonClicked` when the Change bike button is clicked.
 
Next, define a global array variable by adding the following line of code to the `<head>` element:

```html
<script>
	var bikeArr=new Array("Bike.jpg","bike1.jpg","Bike2.jpg","Bike3.jpg","Bike4.jpg");
</script>
```
Now write JavaScript code, which implements the `changeButtonClicked` function. Write your code within the same `<script>` tags of promptButtonClicked.
 
**Your code should do the following:**
1. Calculate a random integer number within the range of bikeArr indices. Use JavaScript’s Math.random() and Math.floor() methods.
2. Retrieve the <img> element from the DOM.
3. Change the src attribute of the image to the file name stored in bikeArr under the random index calculated.
 
⚙️ Test your code.
  
### Implementing in-app links
 
Finally, it’s time to go back to *index.html* and link to the two files we created: *Ride.html* and *Buttons.html*.
 
**Step 14:** Working in index.html: make the Bike Stores `<li>` element link to Buttons.html, and the Go for a Ride `<li>` element link to ride.html.
 
⚙️ Test your code.
